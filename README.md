# Securing Passwords

## Objectives

1. Learn about bcrypt, a gem that works to encrypt passwords.
2. Learn about Active Record's `has_secure_password` method.
3. Sign up and log in a user with a secure, encrypted password.

## Overview

Securing users' data is one of the most important jobs of a web developer.
Despite frequent warnings against it, many of your users will use the same
username and password


combination across many different websites. This means
that, in general, people will use the same password for our applications that
they do for their bank.

Because of this, we never want to store our users' passwords in plain text in
our database. Instead, we'll run the passwords through a hashing algorithm. A
hashing algorithm manipulates data in such a way that it cannot be
un-manipulated. This is to say that if someone got a hold of the hashed version
of a password, they would have no way to turn it back into the original. In
addition to hashing the password, we'll also add a "salt". A salt is simply a
random string of characters that gets added into the hash. That way, if two of
our users use the password "fido", they will end up with different hashes in
our database.

We'll use an open-source gem, `bcrypt`, to implement this strategy.

## Starter Code

We've got a basic Sinatra MVC application. In our `application_controller` we
have two helper methods defined: `logged_in?` returns true or false based on
the presence of a `session[:user_id]`, and `current_user` returns the instance
of the logged in user, based on the `session[:user_id]`. We have six actions
defined:

* `get "/" do` renders an `index.erb` file with links to signup or login.
* `get '/signup'` renders a form to create a new user. The form includes fields for `username` and `password`.
* `get '/login'` renders a form for logging in.
* `get '/success'` renders a `success.erb` page, which should be displayed once a user successfully logs in.
* `get '/failure'` renders a `failure.erb` page. This will be accessed if there is an error logging in or signing up.
* `get '/logout'` clears the session data and redirects to the homepage.

We've also stubbed out a user model in `app/models/user.rb` that inherits from
`ActiveRecord::Base`.

Fork and clone this repository and run `bundle install` to get started!

## Password Encryption with BCrypt

BCrypt will store a salted, hashed version of our users' passwords in our
database in a column called `password_digest`. Essentially, once a password is
salted and hashed, there is no way for anyone to decode it. This method
requires that hackers use a 'brute force' approach to gain access to someone's
account –– still possible, but more difficult.

### Implementing BCrypt

We've created a migration file for you, but you'll need to fill it in. For now,
we'll use `def up` and `def down` methods for this lab, but note that you will
often see `def change` now when generating migrations. Let's edit that file so
that it actually creates a `users` table. We'll have two columns: one for
`username` and one for `password_digest`.

```ruby
class CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.1]
  def up
    create_table :users do |t|
      t.string :username
      t.string :password_digest
    end
  end

  def down
    drop_table :users
  end
end
```

Run this migration using `rake db:migrate`. Preview your work by running
`shotgun` and navigating to [localhost:9393](http://localhost:9393/) in your
browser. Awesome job!

**_NOTE_**: If you're in the Learn IDE, instead of going to
[localhost:9393](http://localhost:9393/) you'll navigate to the URL output by
the `shotgun` command.

### ActiveRecord's `has_secure_password`

Next, let's update our user model so that it includes `has_secure_password`.
This ActiveRecord macro gives us access to a few new methods. A macro is a
method that when called, creates methods for you. This is meta programming,
which you don't need to worry about now. Just know that using a macro is just
like calling a normal ruby method.

In this case, the macro `has_secure_password` is being called just like a
normal ruby method. It works in conjunction with a gem called `bcrypt` and
gives us all of those abilities in a secure way that doesn't actually store the
plain text password in the database.

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_secure_password
end
```

Next, let's handle signing up. In our `post '/signup'` action, let's make a new
instance of our user class with a username and password from params. Note that
even though our database has a column called `password_digest`, we still access
the attribute of `password`. This is given to us by `has_secure_password`. You
can read more about that in the [Ruby Docs](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/SecurePassword/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_secure_password).

```ruby
post "/signup" do
  user = User.new(:username => params[:username], :password => params[:password])
end
```

Because our user has `has_secure_password`, we won't be able to save this to
the database unless our user filled out the password field. Calling `user.save`
will return false if the user can't be persisted. Let's update this route so
that we redirect to `'/login'` if the user is saved, or `'/failure'` if the
user can't be saved. (For now, we'll make the user log in after they sign up
successfully).

```ruby
post "/signup" do
  user = User.new(:username => params[:username], :password => params[:password])

  if user.save
    redirect "/login"
  else
    redirect "/failure"
  end
end
```

Awesome! Test this feature out in your browser. Leaving the password field
blank should land you at the "failure" page, while creating a valid user should
take you to login.

Next, create at least one valid user, then let's build out our login action. In
`post '/login'`, let's find the user by username.

```ruby
post "/login" do
  user = User.find_by(:username => params[:username])
end
```

Next, we need to check two conditions: first, did we find a user with that
username? This can be written as `user != nil` or simply `user`.

```ruby
post "/login" do
  user = User.find_by(:username => params[:username])
  if user
    redirect "/success"
  else
    redirect "/failure"
  end
end
```

We also need to check if that user's password matches up with the value in
`password_digest`. Users must have both an account _and_ know the password.

We validate password match by using a method called `authenticate` on our
`User` model. We do not have write this method ourselves. Rather when we added
the line of code to `User`:

```ruby
class User < ActiveRecord::Base
  has_secure_password
end
```

we told Ruby to add an `authenticate` method to our class (invisibly!) when the
program runs. While we, as programmers can't see it, **it will be there**.

Let's step through the process of how `User`'s `authenticate` method works. It:

1. Takes a `String` as an argument e.g. `i_luv@byron_poodle_darling`
2. It turns the `String` into a salted, hashed version (`76776516e058d2bf187213df6917a7e`)
3. It compares this salted, hashed version with the user's stored salted,
   hashed password in the database
4. If the two versions match, `authenticate` will return the `User` instance;
   if not, it returns `false`

> **IMPORTANT** At no point do we look at an unencrypted version of the user's
> password.

In the code below, we see how we can ensure that we have a `User` AND that that
`User` is authenticated. If the user authenticates, we'll set the
`session[:user_id]` and redirect to the `/success` route. Otherwise, we'll
redirect to the `/failure` route so our user can try again.

```ruby
post "/login" do
  user = User.find_by(:username => params[:username])

  if user && user.authenticate(params[:password])
    session[:user_id] = user.id
    redirect "/success"
  else
    redirect "/failure"
  end
end
```

Awesome job! We've now built out a basic authentication system for a user
without storing a plain-text password in our database.
